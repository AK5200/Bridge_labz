-- js has 8 datatypes
-- undefined v/s null , most users explicitly define the value null for any variable or function
-- it just signifies the var/function dosen't any value,
-- undefined means that particular var/function has not been defined yet.
-- undefined == null (true, as both have no value) but undefined === null (false, types is not same)
-- bigint is when we want to store greater value than that assigned i.e 64bit for every var.
-- bigint 2^53 - 1;
-- Symbol datatype is used to hide a detail.
