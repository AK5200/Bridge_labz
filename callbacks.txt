// In js we can pass a function as a parameter to another function 
// and can call that function after the execution of the first function
// this is called callbacks and it can perform async
// callback hell - situation in js where callbacks are nested within other callbacks
// to the degree where the code is difficult to read.
// oldest way to handle async functions, new we have promises and async/await
