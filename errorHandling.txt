// error - an object which is created to represent  problems.
// try{ } - holds code which might cause error
// catch { } - catch and handle thrown error from try { }
// finally { } - optional, will execute no matter what the result os

// try catch blocks does not interrupt the execution of the later program even if there is an error
// without try catch the program will stop executing as soon as it encounters an error.
//we can also explicitly throw an error using-  throw new Error(`message`)
